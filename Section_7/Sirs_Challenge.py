"""
Finding most efficient n% of a given size of hash table
where
	efficiency is measured in the least amount of collisions but lowest size, and
	'n% of given size' = [SET_SIZE] * (n + 1) for n in range [LOW] â‰¤ n < [HIGH], step [STEP], and
	hash function is [HASH]

each size will be tested [AVG_NUM] amount of times and an average will be drawn

nb.
Jump amount, size, range, and hash function can also be changed to see their effect on collisions
