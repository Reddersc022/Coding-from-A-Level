"""
Done two ways:
	- The easy way:         just prints out the most common words (technically correct)
	- The better way:       takes a random wikipedia article and prints most common words
	- The even better way:  I got bored so I made one that actually webscrapes

Also, it has to be said that Thomas has a very strange pastime
